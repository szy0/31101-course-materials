    "## A simulation of irradiation damage in RPV steel\n",
    "### A collision cascade\n",
    "Before we do anything, we need to decide what it is we want to simulate. As an example, let us consider irradiation damage to a block of pressure vessel steel, exposed to energetic neutrons in a light water nuclear fission reactor. Neutrons are released from the fissile uranium dioxide fuel in the core of the reactor and pass into the crystal lattice of the pressure vessel steel. Many of these neutrons will pass straight through the wall of the pressure vessel without doing any damage, but some will collide with the nuclei of the atoms that make up the pressure vessel. These collisions will transfer large amounts of kinetic energy to these atoms, setting them in motion at high speed. The disturbed atoms will go on to collide with other atoms, these will collide with yet more atoms, and so on. This creates a huge local disturbance (in a region a few hundred nanometers across) in the crystal lattice in a phenomenon known as a *collision cascade*. After only a few nanoseconds this disturbance will be over and, remarkably, most of the damage will have healed and perfect crystal will have been restored. However, a few atoms will not have returned to their perfect lattice sites and so we will have a few point defects left behind. These will be *vacancy* defects (in which a lattice site contains no atom) and *interstitial* defects (in which an atom sits somewhere other than a lattice site). These point defects will move around over time, perhaps forming clusters. Such clusters then act as obstructions to the motion of dislocations, causing the reactor pressure vessel to become brittle. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The role of simulation\n",
    "For this reason, it is important to understand the details of the damage process that we have just described. Few experimental techniques have the time and spatial resolution that would be required to directly observe irradiation damage and so *simulations* are particularly important for studying such processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approximating the phenomenon\n",
    "Unfortunately, a real collision cascade is far too complicated to simulate directly and so we must make approximations in our simulation. Thinking about this more positively we could also say that, in simulating a collision cascade, we can take advantage of the control that we have to simplify the situation. This can make it easier to understand what is going on and to tease out the most important aspects of the real problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we will make the following approximations, in order to make the simulations tractable:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) We do not directly simulate the incoming neutron. Instead we will start our simulation at the point when an atom of the pressure vessel has been set in motion. This atom is known as a primary knock-on atom (pka). Since it is rare for an incoming neutron to initiate a cascade, we would otherwise need to simulate a large amount of material and many neutrons in order to obtain information about a single cascade. In addition to this, if we wanted to directly simulate the process of a collision between a neutron and an atom of the pressure vessel then we would need our simulation to capture the physics of nucleon-nucleon interactions. This is far from trivial.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) We ignore microstructure. Instead we will simulate a small block of perfect single crystal. This allows us to simulate for longer times, but the increased simplicity also allows us to extract details of the damage process that might be obscured by e.g. grain boundaries or dislocations. On the downside, such features often play an important role in determining the level of damage, by acting as defect sinks, for example. We will also avoid the complication of dealing with surfaces of the crystal by employing what are called *periodic boundary conditions*, but we will return to this point shortly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) We ignore the complexity of steel composition. Instead, our block of material will consist of pure iron in the body-centered cubic (bcc) phase. Real steels, of course, contain many other elements, but we might hope that the dominant effect on damage will be determined by the arrangement of the iron atoms in the steel.\n",
    "\n",
    "So our simulation will be as follows: we will set up a small block of pure, defect-free, bcc Fe crystal and set in motion one of the Fe atoms to represent the pka.\n",

    "You may have noticed that the range of the Lennard-Jones potential is infinite: that is to say that even a pair of atoms that is very far apart with still contribute to the total potential energy of our system. However, the strength of the interaction decays quite fast with increasing separation and so there is little advantage to considering pairs of atoms more than a few lattice parameters apart. This fact is often exploited in order to make simulations more efficient: we simply assume that atoms larger than some cut-off distance apart, call it $r_{\\textrm{cut}}$, have only a negligible interaction. This approximation is physically valid for many real materials, such as in metals, but may be less so where long-ranged forces such as the coulomb interaction are important.\n",

Think about what is happening here: atoms are colliding with one another. As an atom approaches a collision it slows down due to the repulsive interaction with the target atom. Its kinetic energy drops, but its potential energy is increasing. Later in the collision, the target atom accelerates away with increasing kinetic energy, and the potential energy drops away.
